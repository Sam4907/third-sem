# Third Semester Portfolio

This monorepo tracks my transition from writing backend exploratory data analysis scripts to deploying full-stack, low-latency web applications. The core theme across the initial projects is breaking down complex sports telemetry data using high-performance computation. Now, as I navigate the ongoing semester, it includes lab coursework.

## Author's Note
After an eventful first year of engineering, I wanted to use this semester break to dive into data analysis and build a solid foundation. It started as a personal challenge to write clean backend exploratory data analysis scripts (`GridVector-Core` and `Regista`).

However, once the data logic was working, I decided to push myself a step further and finally learn frontend development (through `GridVector-App`), which has always been something I've wanted to learn.

With the start of the world cup, I wanted to see if I could predict who'll be crowned champions so I started working on `Into the Qualiverse` (Status report: SUCCESS!).

Additionally, this semester I've been working on a rigorous into the limits of content-hybrid generalizability with my team, which can be found at **[this repo](https://github.com/Sreeya-Rao-E/Content-Hybrid-Kuairec).**

## Repository Structure

The workspace is organized into two primary segments: core exploratory data engines and interactive web applications.
